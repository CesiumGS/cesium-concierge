Hey {{{userId}}}! There's about a week to the CesiumJS release, which I believe you're in charge of!

Now would be a good time to triage the priority next release issues:

https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22priority+-+next+release%22

As well as make sure all tests are running in main, and no big last minute changes are being merged.
